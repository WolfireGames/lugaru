Lugaru: Temple
==============

Welcome to "Lugaru: The Rabbit's Foot"'s unofficial expansion pack. Unofficial,
but free. Like in "Christmas". Introducing...

Lugaru: Temple (aka, The Rabbit's Other Foot)

This includes 31 maps, 85 rabbits + 15 wolves on the receiving side, plus 4
different player characters. All this wraped up in a large campaign, complete
with scenario and dialogue.


Sven is Turner's twin brother (or maybe just a cousin, he was never very clear
on this). He's been training in the desert (see my previous map pack) to become
the new master of his Temple. He has just come back.

The story starts right in the heat of things, and what's happening is only
implied by the dialogues, not flat out explained. But you should figure out very
quickly. The scenario is quite simple and just a frame for the levels.

Be aware that said levels are more demanding than the regular campaign from
both player and computer. I've ensured that every map yields at least 50 FPS on
my 1.67 GHz G4 laptop. Slower camputers may need to lower detail settings to get
consistent gameplay. As for the the player (you there), you should at least have
completed the regular campaign. This one is aimed at people who already know the
normal game well.

Last thing, don't be too upset if there are small glitches. The level editor
is unsupported and reliably crashes when you stare at it the wrong way.

Enjoy!

See you on the wolfire boards-

WARNING: PG-13 rating. About 100 violent deaths on screen. (Also, a relative of
the main character used the word "bastard".)


Troubleshooting
---------------

A rare bug that may be specific to my campaign:
Sometimes, the slow-motion effect which kicks in when you kill an enemy doesn't
stop. You have to deactivate it manually by hitting 'b'. This usually means that
you can't finish the map, even if you kill everyone. You have to restart the
level. I've never encountered this bug with debug mode off, so it's not that
much of a problem.

If a level crashes, replace it with the map 'svenskip' in the Data/Maps folder-
or, more elegant, in the campaign file (Data/Campaigns/temple.txt).


Some useful info
----------------

- All levels where Sven wears his ninja outfit can be completed "One with the
shadows!"-style, ie, you can kill every enemy from behind. This is particularly
tricky in "General Mansion" (map 'svenninja') and "Old Fort" (map 'svenfort').

- The Last Level: Ice Cave
It can be very difficult. If all else fails, read this:
The wolves roll and flip about when you jump with a knife (to avoid being ninja
bull's eye'd). Use this trick near the pits and poof! no wolf.

- Most of the levels are best played for themselves once you know them, without
the constraint of a linear compaign. You may need this:
