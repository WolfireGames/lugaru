Map objectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hotspots
~~~~~~~~

hs (size) (type) (string) - creates a hotspot underneath you.
    The three arguments correspond to the size, type, and text of the hotspot,
    respectively. See below for the explanations of each type integer:
        type 0 = static, display text
        type 1-10 = attached to player 1-10, display text
        type 11-20 = attached to player 1-10, must kill to win
        type -1 = win if approached
dhs - deletes the last hotspot.
    An example is "hs 15.0 0 sdf". Note that hotspots are very buggy (TODO:
    review once bugs are fixed), especially those not of type 0. Quitting and
    restarting Lugaru, then creating a hotspot in a simple map first, can help.
    You may have to fiddle around with this. Some strings may be randomly
    rejected, but if you know how to hex-edit, you can change them directly in
    the map file (make sure to change the byte before the string to the number
    of its characters).

Graphics
~~~~~~~~

viewdistance (float) - sets the far clipping plane.
    In other words, it controls how far you can see before the fog obscures it.
    Its value is based on 1, that is, 1.5 is 50% farther.
fadestart (float) - sets what fraction of the viewdistance an object must pass
    to begin fading. In other words, it controls how far an object has to be
    before it starts becoming transparent. Its value is based on 1, that is,
    1.5 is 50% farther.

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

quit - quits Lugaru.
slomo (float) - toggles slow motion on or off.
    If it's turning on, the game speed is controlled by the floating point
    value. The value is based on 1, that is, 0.5 is 50% slower than normal game
    speed.
slofreq (integer) - sets the slow motion sound frequency.

The following commands have unknown effects: metal, sizemin, fixrotation,
fixtype.
